/// Crossover strategy for combining genetic material from two parents.
///
/// Crossover is a fundamental genetic algorithm operation that creates offspring by
/// combining genetic material from two parent genotypes. This enum provides different
/// strategies for how genes are selected and combined.
///
/// # Strategies
///
/// ## Uniform Crossover
/// Each gene position is independently selected from either parent based on a probability.
/// This provides fine-grained mixing of genetic material and is excellent for exploring
/// the solution space when genes are largely independent.
///
/// **When to use:**
/// - Problems where genes don't have strong positional dependencies
/// - When you want maximum genetic diversity in offspring
/// - For exploration-heavy phases of optimization
///
/// ## Single-Point Crossover
/// Selects a random cut point and takes genes before the cut from one parent and
/// genes after the cut from the other parent. This preserves larger genetic segments
/// and is ideal when genes have positional relationships.
///
/// **When to use:**
/// - Problems where adjacent genes work together (building blocks)
/// - When you want to preserve genetic segments
/// - For exploitation-focused optimization phases
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use fx_durable_ga::models::Crossover;
///
/// // Uniform crossover with 60% chance of selecting from first parent
/// let uniform = Crossover::uniform(0.6)?;
///
/// // Single-point crossover for preserving gene segments
/// let single_point = Crossover::single_point();
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Configuration Guidelines
///
/// **For exploration (early optimization):**
/// - Use `Uniform` with probability around 0.4-0.6
/// - Higher genetic diversity helps find promising regions
///
/// **For exploitation (later optimization):**
/// - Use `SinglePoint` to preserve successful gene combinations
/// - Or `Uniform` with probability closer to 0.5 for balanced mixing
///
/// **Problem-specific considerations:**
/// - Permutation problems: Often benefit from specialized crossover (consider SinglePoint)
/// - Continuous optimization: Uniform crossover typically works well
/// - Combinatorial problems: Test both strategies to see which preserves building blocks better
